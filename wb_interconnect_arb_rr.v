 * This is a round-robin arbiter for N participants, which is a
 * parameter. The arbiter itself contains no register but is purely
 * combinational which allows for various use cases. It simply
 * calculates the next grant (nxt_gnt) based on the current grant
 * (gnt) and the requests (req).
 *
 * That means, the gnt should in general be a register and especially
 * there must be no combinational path from nxt_gnt to gnt!
 *
 * The normal usage is something like registering the gnt from
 * nxt_gnt. Furthermore it is important that the gnt has an initial
 * value which also must be one hot!

   // At a first glance, the computation of the nxt_gnt signal looks
   // strange, but the principle is easy:
   //
   //  * For each participant we compute a mask of width N. Based on
   //    the current gnt signal the mask contains a 1 at the position
   //    of other participants that will be served in round robin
   //    before the participant in case they request it.
   //
   //  * The mask is 0 on all positions for the participant "left" of
   //    the currently granted participant as no other has precedence
   //    over this one. The mask has all one except the participant
   //    itself for the currently arbitrated participant.
   //
   //  * From the mask and the request the nxt_gnt is calculated,
   //    roughly said as: if there is no other participant which has a
   //    higher precedence that also requests, the participant gets
   //    granted.
   //

   //  req     = 1010
   //  gnt     = 1000
